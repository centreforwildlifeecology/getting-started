Sometimes it feels like all we do is sit at our computers all day and code in R. But sometimes we take a break from coding in R to ask each other questions about coding in R. And sometimes we like to share the R code we spent all day coding. This GitHub group could make that easier.

## Getting started with Git and GitHub

Everyone hates Git. Here's some reasons why people use it anyway and how you can use it, too.

## OK, that was nice background, but what do I do??

Think of GitHub as a combination of Dropbox and Microsoft's "track changes." You can store a file locally on your computer and remotely in the cloud, and you can sync changes between them just like Dropbox or Google Drive. But Git tracks all the changes that were made between syncs (like track changes) so you can see what's new and decide what to do if there are conflicting versions.

Very soon I will write a short tutorial explaining how to do basic things in GitHub.

## Legal stuff

This is a student-run group and is not officially affiliated with the Centre for Wildlife Ecology or Simon Fraser University.

Stuff in this group is licensed under the GNU GPLv3. Basically, this means other people can use and alter the code here, as long as any changes or improvements they make are also open source. You should read the details and if you don't like what you read, talk to the lab about changing the license or don't post your code here.
