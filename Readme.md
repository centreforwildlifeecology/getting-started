Sometimes it feels like all we do is sit at our computers all day and code in R. But sometimes we take a break from coding in R to ask each other questions about coding in R. And sometimes we like to share the R code we spent all day coding. This GitHub group could make that easier.

## Legal stuff

This is a student-run group and is not officially affiliated with the Centre for Wildlife Ecology or Simon Fraser University.

Stuff in this group is licensed under the GNU GPLv3. Basically, this means other people can use and alter the code here, as long as any changes or improvements they make are also open source. You should read the details and if you don't like what you read, talk to the lab about changing the license or don't post your code here.
